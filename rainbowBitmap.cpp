/* Allegro Newbie Tutorial : Lesson 2 - Bitmaps 
 * This lesson will initialize allegro, set up keyboard support, 
 * show a single bitmap, then wait for a keypress. Upon the keypress 
 * the program will then quit.
 */

// Here is your first line. You must include the allegro header file or else nothing will work!
#include <allegro.h> // You must include the Allegro Header file

/* Our generic main function. */
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
	
	// Now we want to initialize allegro just as we did in our last lesson.
	allegro_init(); // Initialize Allegro 

	// Now we want to install the keyboard just as we did in our last lesson.	
	install_keyboard(); // Initialize keyboard routines
	
	/* This next step is something new. When you actually draw bitmaps to the screen you must 
	 * specify a color depth that the screen will have.
	 * 
	 * set_color_depth will change the current color depth. 
	 * 
	 * Available depths are 8,15,16, 24, and 32. 
	 * A color depth of 8 requires a palette to be loaded with each bitmap, so we will not use it. 
	 * A color depth of 32 can use a lot of resources, so we will either use 15 or 16 in order to ensure 
	 * maximum compatabiliy between machines.
	 *
	 * Make sure that you change the color depth before you change the screen resolution. 
	 * If you fail to do so, your bitmaps will not display with the correct colors!
	 */
	set_color_depth(desktop_color_depth()); // Set the color depth
	set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT_WINDOWED, 640,480,0,0); // Change our graphics mode to 640x480
	
	/* This is the BITMAP structure. 
	 * Every time you want to create an image to display, or to draw to, 
	 * you must declare it with BITMAP, just like when you want an integer, 
	 * you declare it with int. Since BITMAP in the allegro libarary is a pointer, 
	 * every instance of a bitmap you create must be preceded by a *
	 */
	BITMAP *my_pic = NULL; // Declare a BITMAP called my_pic, setting it's initial value to NULL
	
	/* Now, the bitmap my_pic is "empty". In order to load a picture into it, 
	 * you must call the function load_bitmap(); 
	 *
	 * Next, we will load a bitmap image from the hard disk into the bitmap my_pic.
	 *
	 * Here are what the parameters mean:
     *	load_bitmap("Location of the bitmap", palette);
	 *
	 * In place of the palette, we will pass NULL - meaning that no palette is used/needed. 
	 *
	 * We can't just call the function load_bitmap by itself, however. 
	 * We must specify that we are loading the bitmap into the memory of my_pic. It is done like so: 
	 * (note, the bitmap must actually exist at this location. If not, the program will crash when 
	 * trying to load it. Functions exist to check for such errors, but they will be left out for 
	 * now to keep this lesson ultra-simple)
	 */
	my_pic = load_bitmap("Rainbow.bmp", NULL); // Load our picture
	 
    if (my_pic == NULL)
   		 allegro_message("allegro failed to load bitmap");
    else 
   	    allegro_message("allegro successful");
	/* Now that our bitmap is loaded into memory, we want to display it onto the screen. 
	 * To do this we use a function called blit. Here are the parameters: 
	 *
	 * blit(bitmap to draw, destination bitmap (usually the screen), clip x, clip y, x position, y position, width, height); 
	 *
	 * As you can see, blit offers a lot of functionality. 
	 * The clipx and clipy will be the upper left hand corner of the bitmap that you want to copy. 
	 * For instance, if you use 0,0 - you will get the bitmap from the top left corner exactly. 
	 * However, if you use 50,50 - you will get the bitmap using the position 50,50 as the upper left hand 
	 * corner. You also need to specity the width and height. This will allow you to clip the image from the 
	 * other sides. Don't worry, we will demonstrate all the capabilities of blitting in the upcoming lessons.
	 * 
	 * Now, lets just display the entire bitmap in the upper left hand corner of the screen
	 */
    line(screen, 0, 0 , 480, 360, 0x100);

	blit(my_pic, screen, 0,0,0,0,480,360); //Draw the whole bitmap to the screen at (0,0)
	
		readkey();
  //  allegro_message("allegro failed to initialize");
	/* We now want to wait for a keypress before we exit the program. */
	readkey();// Wait untill a key is pressed
	/* The next step is critical before exiting the program.
	 * The destroy_bitmap function is used to clear out the space in memory that a bitmap was utilizing. 
	 * Make sure you destroy all bitmaps that you used in your program, so garbage data doesn't stay behind in memory.
	 */
	destroy_bitmap(my_pic); //Release the bitmap data

	
	/* Return 0 at the end of main, indicating a exit without errors */
	return 0; // Exit with no errors
